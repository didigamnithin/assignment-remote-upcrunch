# Changes Summary - Store-Level Only Analysis

## Changes Made to Address User Requests

### 1. Remove July 29 from Payout Date ✅
- **Location**: `script.py` main function (lines ~2650-2660)
- **Implementation**: Added filtering logic to exclude July 29, 2025 from the payouts dataset
- **Code**: 
  ```python
  # Filter payouts to exclude July 29, 2025
  if not pay.empty and "Payout Date" in pay.columns:
      pay = parse_datetime_column(pay, "Payout Date")
      july_29_filter = pay["Payout Date"].dt.date != pd.to_datetime("2025-07-29").date()
      pay = pay[july_29_filter]
  ```

### 2. Remove August 11 from All Analysis (End on August 10) ✅
- **Location**: `script.py` main function (lines ~2660-2680)
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive date filtering to all datasets to end on August 10, 2025
- **Code**:
  ```python
  # Filter all datasets to end on August 10, 2025
  august_10_end = pd.to_datetime("2025-08-10")
  
  # Applied to all datasets: marketing, operations, payouts, sales, ubereats
  ```

### 3. Remove All Overall Metrics - Store-Level Only Analysis ✅
- **Location**: All sections (Marketing, Operations, Sales, Payouts, UberEats)

- **Changes**:
  - Removed overall KPI cards from all sections
  - Removed "All Stores" option from store selection
  - Removed overall time series charts and comparisons
  - Removed overall summary statistics and heatmaps
  - Focused exclusively on individual store analysis

### 4. Store Selection Improvements ✅
- **Location**: All sections
- **Implementation**: Modified store selection to default to first store instead of "All Stores"
- **Changes**:
  - Removed "All Stores" button from all sections
  - Default selection is now the first available store
  - Removed "Back to All Stores" buttons
  - Simplified store selection interface

### 5. Section Descriptions Updated ✅
- **Location**: All section headers
- **Implementation**: Updated descriptions to reflect store-level focus
- **Changes**:
  - Marketing: "Store-level campaign performance, customer acquisition, and ROI analysis"
  - Operations: "Store-level performance, ratings, and operational efficiency metrics"
  - Sales: "Store-level revenue analysis, order trends, and financial performance"
  - Payouts: "Store-level payment analysis, commission tracking, and financial settlements"
  - UberEats: "Store-level sales and payout analysis for UberEats operations"

### 6. Data Summary Information ✅
- **Location**: All sections
- **Implementation**: Added consistent data summary information across all sections
- **Features**:
  - Number of rows loaded
  - Date range information
  - Filtering confirmation messages
  - Zero values analysis (Marketing section)

## Technical Details

### Date Filtering Logic
- **July 29 Filter**: Uses `.dt.date` comparison to exclude specific date
- **August 10 Filter**: Uses `filter_df_by_date` function with end date parameter
- **Applied to**: All major datasets (marketing, operations, payouts, sales, ubereats)

### Zero Values Analysis
- **Metrics Analyzed**: Orders, Sales, Marketing Fees, ROAS
- **Display Format**: "X/Y (Z%)" showing zero count, total count, and percentage
- **Purpose**: Help identify if zero values are expected or indicate data issues

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: All filtering operations check for empty dataframes and missing columns
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages when data is missing or empty
- **Debug Information**: Added to help troubleshoot data issues

## Files Modified
1. `script.py` - Main application file with all filtering logic and debugging features

## Testing
- ✅ Syntax check passed
- ✅ Application runs without errors
- ✅ Date filtering applied correctly
- ✅ Debug information displays properly

## User Experience Improvements
- Clear feedback about applied filters
- Detailed analysis of zero values
- Improved datetime parsing performance
- Better error handling and user messaging
